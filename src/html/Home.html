        <img src="../Resources/image1.jpeg" alt="Club Meeting">
        <p>As the first general computer science club on campus, we're excited to bring together programmers of all skill levels. Experienced or just beginning, we value your interest in coding. You don't need to be a computer science major to join â€“ if coding intrigues you, you're in the right place.

            As a group, we will build our resumes, portfolios, and professional networks. We will attend guest speaker events from influential companies and prepare for interviews to aid your journey in the industry.
            
            If you are interested, come by our next event and find out what we're all about!</p>
